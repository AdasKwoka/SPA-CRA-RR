# Description

A sample single page application created on the basis of CRA and using React Router. I used such concepts as stateful components and stateless function components. I also demonstrated using asynchronous fetch method to fetch a small amount of data from json file which was also added to the base application.

## How to use

1. In the first step, copy the link to the data in the repository
2. Then in the terminal, select the folder to which you want to clone the repository
3. Clone the repository using the command

### `git clone /link/`

4. To be able to run our project you need to install the node modules package using the command in your terminal in the directory where you cloned the repository

### `npm install`

5. Finally, to start the application you need to enter the command

### `npm start`
